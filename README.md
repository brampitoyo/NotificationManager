# NTFY app
A notifications manager on Android.

## V0.5
Display a list of apps that the user has and provide a quick way to disable/enable their notifications.

## V1
Allow the user to create basic categories/contexts (location, time, etc) for when to mute which notifications.

## V2 (for later)
Provide more detailed control over notifications, such as different cues (visual, sounds, vibrations, etc), priority (levels?), other contexts around them that we didn't explore yet (location, time, etc).
